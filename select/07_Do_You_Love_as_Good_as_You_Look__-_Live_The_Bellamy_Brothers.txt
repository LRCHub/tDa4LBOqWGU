Long blonde hair, sky blue eyes
Yeah that well-bred look is easy to recognize
A tailored dress, a fit so fine
And it adds up to the question on my mind

Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Can you satisfy your man, like your body says you can?
Judging from the cover, I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?

If you could read my mind, you might blush blood-red
But then again you might come over here instead
I see they brought your check and soon you're bound to go

If I don't make my move right now, I may never know

Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Can you satisfy your man, like your body says you can?
Judging from the cover, I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?

Judging from the cover, I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Honey, do you love as good as you look?...
